# IMPORTANT INFORMATION
All proxy addresses that will run on dash have good anonymity and security and are obtained from the below repositories.<br>
[clarketm's proxy list](https://github.com/clarketm/proxy-list)

# Setting up and using Dash
if the repo gets banned on your school network you can clone it and make your own by cloning the main.
first start a new repo or code space and clone the main repon using the below command
```
$ git clone https://github.com/stylo-codes-stuff/DashProxyApp.git
```
then follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) for making the repo into a github pages site and if nothing goes wrong you should be able to visit and use your proxy site hassle free

# Running in online IDEs/VMs
If you are using a site such as replit or code sandbox to host dash use the same command to clone and in your terminal run this command after Changing your directory to the newly created project folder
```
npm run DashProxyApp
```
When using this method instead of being hosted on a local port you should be able to find it on the sites respective project URL. (ex. Replit URL looks like ProjectName.username.repl.co)
